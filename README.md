# Personal Development Plan

## LO1:
Student plans and executes a project in their track at level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity, in an agile way.

**In my own words:**
I want to build a small pet robot, while focusing on two main activities: analysis and design. Specifically i wish to start by analysing the market of smiliar products that already exist and then draw up and design my own version of the product based on that analysis. This is on level 2 of the HBO-i framework since problems that may arise are solved autonomously and solutions are limited for the problem.

**Plan:**
### Week 1:
