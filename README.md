# Personal Development Plan

## LO1:
Student plans and executes a project in their track at level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity, in an agile way.

**In my own words:**
I want to build a small pet robot, while focusing on two main activities: analysis and design. Specifically i wish to start by analysing the market of smiliar products that already exist and then draw up and design my own version of the product based on that analysis. This is on level 2 of the HBO-i framework since problems that may arise are solved autonomously and solutions are limited for the problem.

**Plan:**
### Week 1:
Market analysis of similar products:  
[Anki Cozmo Robot](https://ankicozmorobot.com/)  
[Anki Vector Robot](https://anki.bot/)  
[Difference between Cozmo and Vector](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnkiVector/comments/cknxyo/whats_difference_in_vector_and_cozmo/)  
[Cozmo Specs](https://people.tamu.edu/~hsieh/ICIA/CozmoRobot/CozPendant.pdf)  
[Anki Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(American_company))  
[Why Did Anki Go Bankrupt](https://www.failory.com/cemetery/anki)  

### Week 2:
Analysis of what parts are needed and how to use them:  
[C library for voice recognition](https://github.com/H2CO3/libsprec)  
[Offline voice recognition](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1ahj7p1/fully_offline_voice_recognition_module_with/)  
[DC Motor control](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/motor-shield-rev3/msr3-controlling-dc-motor/)  
[Voice recognition sensor](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2665.html?tracking=65bf32787571b)  
[Parts list](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4e-repository-group_e01/blob/main/doc/parts_list.md)  

### Week 3:
Design Electrical layout:  
[How to draw electrical diagrams](https://www.smartdraw.com/circuit-diagram/how-to-draw-electrical-diagrams.htm)  

### Week 4:
Learn how to use physical components:  
[Soldering](/doc/): Can be observed in any of the videos.  
[Blinking LED](/doc): No video taken but next step is traffic light.  
[Traffic Light](/doc/Traffic_Light.mp4)  

### Week 5:
Learn how to use physical components:  
[Heartbeat](/doc/): Can be observed in any of the videos.  
[PWM](/doc/PWM.mp4)  
[Gyroscope](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-mpu-6050-accelerometer-gyroscope-arduino/)  

### Week 6:
Learn how to use physical components:  
[I2C](/doc/I2C.mp4)  

### Week 7:
Learn how to use physical components:  
[Analog reading](/doc/Analog_Input.mp4)  

### Week 8:
First project week, connect first sensors and components.  

## LO2:
Student applies professional skills at level 2 in the focus areas: future-oriented organization, investigative ability, personal leadership, and targeted interaction.

**In my own words:**

Future-Oriented organization: I will keep all future social and enviromental factors in mind that may hinder me while working towards the clear defined end of the project.  
Investigative ability: I will keep an eye open for issues during the project, identify what is lacking and look for the appropriate means to fix the issue, all while keeping an open mind for different solutions.  
Personal leadership: I will listen to all team members and relevant stakeholders on their feedback and incorporate it into the project.  
Targeted interaction: Similar to personal leadership i will keep communication open with all team members and relevant stakeholders to facilitate an enviroment of collaboration.

**Plan:**
### Week 1:
Future-Oriented organization: Look at the market analysis, it gives good insight into the future of this project since similar products already exist and we can learn from them for risks and factors.  
Investigative ability: No issues so far, just things that need to get done like the Project Charter and component details.  
Personal leadership: [Feedback](https://canvas.fontys.nl/courses/26466/external_tools/162)  
Targeted interaction: The project idea has been continuosly developed with the team and feedback from the project coach has been incorporated as seen in the [project idea](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4e-repository-group_e01/blob/main/doc/Project_4_Project_Idea.pdf).  

### Week 2:
Future-Oriented organization: A parts list has been made, this can also give insight into what problems may occour.  
Investigative ability: The parts list and how to use certain parts, plus c and arduino libraries that have been found show a good investigative ability.  
Personal leadership: [Feedback](https://canvas.fontys.nl/courses/26466/external_tools/162)  
Targeted interaction: The [Parts list](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4e-repository-group_e01/blob/main/doc/parts_list.md) has been created and discussed with the team and will be discussed with the project coach.
